# Palindrome

A **palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.

## Task

Using a stack, determine whether a string is a palindrome. Strings may contain punctuation and spaces. They should be ignored. Case also should be ignored.


## Examples

```java
isPalindrome("I did, did I?")
//should return true
isPalindrome("Racecar")
//should return true
```
