# Convert String to Camel Case

Write a method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

### Examples

```java
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior"); // *returns "theStealthWarrior"*
toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior"); // *returns "TheStealthWarrior"*
```
